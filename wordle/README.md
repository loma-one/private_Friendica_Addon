Wordle Addon
=============

This is a quick and dirty addon to add a Wordle website as an app. This Addon based on webrtc.

Valyrian Wordle is a re-implementation of the modern classic Wordle game into the constructed language of High Valyrian, constructed by David J. Peterson for George RR Martin's A Song of Ice of Fire and HBO's Game of Thrones.

Guess the word in no more than six tries! Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

A new word will be available to guess daily, so come back tomorrow!
