Tux Addon
=============

This is a quick and dirty addon to add a Tux website as an app. This Addon based on webrtc.

SuperTux Classic is a 2D platformer game where where you play as a penguin in Antarctica!

It is a complete remaster of the Milestone 1 version of SuperTux (versions 0.1.0 - 0.1.4) created from the ground up in the Godot engine! It features enhanced graphics, sounds, music, and gameplay, but retains the core design reminiscent of classic platformer titles such as Super Mario Bros.

The game is completely open source, being licensed under the GNU GPL. This means you can do whatever you like with the game's source files (under the license's conditions), whether that's redistributing the game, making mods, re-skins, custom levels, you name it!

The source code is available here: https://github.com/Alzter/SuperTux-Classic/
